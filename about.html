          <h5 class="about-info">Greetings, <br><br>
            My name is Susan Holland and I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself as well as my new

            attended Basic Law Enforcement Training at James Sprunt Community College in Kenansville, North Carolina in
            2005. On August 20, 2005 I began my career at Duplin County Sheriff's Office as a Deputy in the Child

            surveillance techniques as well as other Investigative skills. On December 6, 2012 I was transferred to the
            Criminal Investigations Unit. During that time, I have been the lead investigator in several major felony
            investigations. I have taken numerous classes related to this position. I attended ICAC Training July 2015
            in order to investigate crimes against children. I attended Coastal Plain Law Enforcement Training Center on

            2016, and Advanced Interview and Interrogation. I attended the North Carolina Homicide investigators

            Carolina Homicide Investigators Association 2017 Fall Training Conference. <br><br>
            After retirement I applied for a Private Investigator License and opened up Holland's Investigative

            confidential and discreet investigations for those who enlist my services. <br><br>
